Developed as part of Deakin Universityâ€™s Engineering AI Solutions module. Combines Azure Computer Vision, Custom Vision, and OpenCV for small-object tracking in video frames.

# Object Detection & Tracking with Azure Computer Vision and Custom Vision

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for object detection and tracking using Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision and Custom Vision APIs. It was developed as part of the SIG788 - Engineering AI Solutions module at Deakin University.

##  Overview

The solution is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Object Detection (Static Images)
- Utilizes **Azure Computer Vision REST API** to detect objects in user-uploaded images.
- Extracts bounding box coordinates and classification labels.
- Visualizes results using Python libraries: `PIL`, `matplotlib`, and `ipywidgets`.

### Part 2: Object Tracking (Video Frames)
- Uses **Azure Custom Vision** to track objects across video frames.
- Trained a custom model using manually labeled images.
- Annotates bounding boxes and tracks object trajectories.
- Reconstructs annotated video and exports movement data to CSV.
